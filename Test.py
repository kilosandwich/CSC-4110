#This is a first python script for CSC 4110
#The purpose of this script is to show that the IDE Visual Studio Code is working
#The output of the code should be shown at the 'terminal' section of the lower bit of Visual studio code
#click the triangle 'run' button in the upper left corner to run the code

#This program will also serve to refamiliarize yourself with python
#comments are made with '#'
""" multiline cmments are made using triple quotes
technically it's a multiline string, but don't worry about
it, you can just leave large empty strings in the middle of your code
"""
#python doesn't require leaving ; at the end of every line, how cool is that?
#import is done using the 'import' command
#yeah...don't forget to set a file path, which also requires you to 
#import. ETC. 

#The good news is you don't have to know all of this perfectly,
#just gooogle it every time.

#indexes start at 0, so that's nice. 

print("Hello World")
print("This should be working")
