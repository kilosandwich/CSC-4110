#Bad News, I have to fundamentally rewrite Snake With A Gun to be more friendly for multiple objects being spawned
#The new plan is to have all objects be stored in a master list
#the master list will then have functions for checking collision (leading to death, bisection, or growth)
#the master list will then render every object in the master list after collision checking has been completed

#object lists will be composed of the following
#ML[][0] = ID (if ID is same, don't check for collision for bullets, its a waste of time), if the ID is negative, it is a bullet ABS of ID will return snake that fired it, player is 1 
#ML[][1] = direction (this is the direction the snake is moving, if a snake becomes bisected, its copy consisting of all points past the bisection
# must also have the same direction)
#Direction for the AI snakes will be based on blindly aiming for the food by adjusting their x and y, AI snakes should have a 'look ahead' to determine when to turn
